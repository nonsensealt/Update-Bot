To run this on Railway:

1. Create a GitHub Repository
   - Upload all files: `.env`, `package.json`, `botupdatechecker.js`
   - Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (don't commit secrets)

2. Deploy on Railway

   - Connect your GitHub repo to Railway

   - Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:

     - `WEBHOOK_URL`: Your Discord webhook URL
     - `ROLE_ID`: 1424935627492818984 (or empty)
     - `NODE_ENV`: production

3. Configure

   - Railway will install dependencies and run `npm start`
   - The bot will run 24/7, checking for updates every hour
   - Use Railway's volume mounting for persistent `last_update.txt` if needed (or use in-memory)

4. Update `.env`

   - Replace the webhook URL in `.env` with your actual URL
   - Railway will override these with env vars you set
